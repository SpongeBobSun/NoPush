#NoPush

** Developing and NOT tested!!! **

NoPush is a message push library for android developers.

Like many other push libraries such as JPush, BaiduPush etc.

But, unlike those libs, push library provide push service with less permissions and it's open source, which give a guarantee of NOT ABUSE and DO NOT DO EVIL. Yes, I said it, DO NOT DO EVIL.

I don't like libs from some "big companies" and with a commercial license and NOT open source. I don't like the feeling of my phone or tablet f*cked by those "big companies".

I know in anywhere else but China mainland and north Korea, these push libraries are bullsh*t. They can just use Google's service.

So, there you go. A push lib using ** node js **  as server. Open source. Complete free ( Free software, not free beer).

You can deploy it on your own server and push your message, ads, images to your app users.

## About the name
Hey, why NoPush? Is it a push library or not?

Just a combination of Nodejs and Push. And I think it's a funny name. Sue me.
